NE555 LED FLASHER CIRCUIT



DESCRIPTION

The 555 monolithic timing circuit is a highly stable controller capableof producing accurate time delays, or oscillation. In the time delaymode of operation, the time is precisely controlled by one externalresistor and capacitor. For a stable operation as an oscillator, thefree running frequency and the duty cycle are both accuratelycontrolled with two external resistors and one capacitor. The circuitmay be triggered and reset on falling waveforms, and the outputstructure can source or sink up to 200mA.

FEATURES

•Turn-off time less than 2μs

•Max. operating frequency greater than 500kHz

•Timing from microseconds to hours

•Operates in both astable and monostable modes

•High output current

•Adjustable duty cycle

•TTL compatible

•Temperature stability of 0.005% per °C



2 leds are connected to the output. The first LED is in the high position, while the second is in the low position. The first is in the low position, while the second is in the high position. A potentiometer is connected to look at the result by adjusting different values.

tH = 0.6963(Ra+Rb)C

tL = 0.693(Rb)C

Period = tH + tL = 0.693(Ra+2Rb)C

f = 1.44/(Ra+2Rb)C
